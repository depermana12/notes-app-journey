My journey of building a notes app from the ground up, serving as a practical exercise and implementation bunch of concepts learned in Frontend Masters courses. The project starts with a simple CLI and gradually evolves into a full-stack application with advanced features.

# Current Stages:

### 1. CLI (No Dependencies, FS Storage)

basic command-line interface for creating and managing notes. Data is stored in the file system.


### 2. CLI (yargs, SQLite3)

CLI utilizing the yargs library for improved command handling and SQLite3 for structured data persistence.


### 3. UI (Vanilla JS, localStorage)

graphical user interface built with vanilla JavaScript, providing a more user-friendly experience. Notes are stored in the browser's localStorage.


### 4. Full Stack (Node, PostgreSQL, React):
complete full-stack application with a Node.js and PostgreSQL backend and a React frontend.


## Future Stages:
- Next.js: Migrate the frontend to Next.js for improved performance and server-side rendering capabilities.
- OpenAI Integration: Explore the possibilities of integrating OpenAI's language models to enhance the note-taking experience. (e.g., automated tagging, summarization, content generation)

# Key Features:
- Note creation and management: Add, edit, delete, and view notes.
- Search functionality: Efficiently search for notes by keywords or content.
- Data persistence: Securely store notes in various storage mechanisms.
- User-friendly interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both CLI and GUI versions.

# Technologies Used:

- Frontend: JavaScript, TypeScript React, Next.js
- Backend: Node.js, PostgreSQL
- CLI: yargs
- Database: SQLite3, PostgreSQL
- Devops: Docker
- Storage: File System, localStorage
- AI: OpenAI (planned)

# Project Goals:

1. Deepen understanding of web development concepts.
2. Gain practical experience with various technologies.
3. Build a functional app.
4. Explore the potential of AI.
